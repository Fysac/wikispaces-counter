wikispaces-counter 
==
An online user counter specifically designed for Wikispaces.

Quick Setup
====
Somewhere on your wiki (I suggest the navigation menu because it loads with every page), add an HTML widget with the following code:

````
<script src="http://errror.mooo.com/wikispaces/counter/counter.js"></script>
````
